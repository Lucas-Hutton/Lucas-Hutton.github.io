<h1>Building Façade Fault Detection – Turnstone Construction</h1>
<div class="project-subtitle">AI-Assisted Automated Building Inspection Prototype</div>

<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>
During my internship at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/turnstone-construction-ltd/posts/?feedView=all" style="color: #006fed; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Turnstone Construction</a>, I contributed to the development 
of an automated building façade inspection system. The goal was to improve the speed, safety, and accuracy of condition monitoring on high-rise buildings. 
The concept involved mounting an imaging system onto the cradle of a Building 
Maintenance Unit (BMU) so that façades could be continuously scanned during 
routine window-cleaning operations.
</p>

<p>
I designed a working prototype capable of capturing high-resolution façade imagery 
and running onboard computer-vision analysis to detect defects such as cracks, 
corrosion, seal failures, and other surface faults. The collected data was processed 
using a trained AI vision model which automatically flagged potential issues for 
building management review.

<h3>My Contributions</h3>
<p>
I was responsible for the end-to-end prototype design and integration, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mechanical design:</strong> Designed the protective casing and mounting interface for the unit, ensuring secure attachment to the BMU cradle while maintaining environmental protection, vibration resistance, and serviceability.</li>
  <li><strong>Electronics design:</strong> Designed the circuitry supporting the microcomputer and onboard cameras, including power distribution, signal routing, and integration of peripheral sensors required for reliable outdoor operation.</li>
  <li><strong>Embedded AI deployment:</strong> Implemented the computer-vision model on an NVIDIA Jetson platform, optimising inference performance and deploying the supporting code for real-time image capture, processing, and fault reporting.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Detection Outputs</h3>

<p>
The prototype successfully demonstrated automated façade inspection in a real 
operational environment. Following validation trials, the project secured further 
investment and was subsequently developed commercially as a <a href="https://facadeai.com/" style="color: #006fed; text-decoration: underline;" target="_blank">Façade AI Ltd</a>.
