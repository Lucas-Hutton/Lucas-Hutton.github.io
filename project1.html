  <h1>Autonomous Robot</h1>
  <div class="project-subtitle">Mobile robotics project focusing on navigation and obstacle avoidance</div>

  <p>
    This project involved the design and development of a fully autonomous mobile robot capable of navigating
    complex indoor environments. The primary goal was to create a platform that could detect obstacles,
    map its surroundings, and make navigation decisions without manual input.
  </p>

  <p>
    The robot was developed as part of a multidisciplinary engineering project combining mechanical design,
    electronics integration, and software development. Special attention was given to ensuring the system
    remained modular so that sensors and control systems could be upgraded independently.
  </p>

  <p>
    The mechanical structure of the robot was designed using CAD software, with emphasis on durability and
    weight reduction. Components were manufactured using a combination of 3D printing and laser cutting,
    allowing for rapid prototyping and iterative testing throughout development.
  </p>

  <p>
    Drive control was achieved using a differential wheel system powered by DC motors with encoder feedback.
    This configuration enabled accurate motion control and allowed for precise distance and speed measurement.
  </p>

  <p>
    The robot utilised ultrasonic and infrared sensors to detect nearby obstacles. Sensor fusion techniques
    were implemented to improve detection reliability and minimise false readings caused by environmental noise.
  </p>

  <p>
    The control algorithm was written in C++ and implemented on a microcontroller platform. A proportional
    navigation approach was used to allow the robot to dynamically adjust its trajectory when encountering obstacles.
  </p>

  <p>
    Extensive testing was conducted in a controlled environment designed to simulate real-world navigation
    challenges. Performance metrics such as response time, obstacle detection accuracy, and path efficiency
    were recorded and analysed to refine the control system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final system demonstrated reliable autonomous navigation and provided a strong foundation for future
    development, including the integration of advanced mapping techniques such as SLAM and computer vision.
